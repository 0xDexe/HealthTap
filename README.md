There are so many workout and diet apps these days that it gets confusing which one to
choose and which one to use. In terms of market share, the market is saturated with all
these apps so obviously there is no need for any more fitness apps. <br><br>
When we check the demographics for these app users, you find that most of these people are young adults
who are either students or of the working class. The main issue that these people have
is scheduling their exercises and tracking their progress i.e. how much weight loss
occurs or how much progress have they made with respect to weights. <br><br>
That is where our app HealthTap comes in.
